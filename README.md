=========

Factorize your enemies out of existence!!!

Shoot invaders out of the sky before they reach your base.  The catch is that they're only susceptible to fire tuned to their specific weaknesses.  Each enemy is marked with a number, and prime factor ammo is required to take them down.  Blast away an enemy's factor shield to completely destroy it.  Hits with the wrong factor will only anger the enemy causing it to dive faster.  Prime enemies die from one good hit, but compound enemies may require several.
